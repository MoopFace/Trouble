datapack for tetra compat with some mods

THIS PACK WORKS BUT IT'S PRETTY HACKY DON'T JUDGE ME JUST USE IT FOR REFERENCE

this is a datapack that I made to implement compatability for some of my favorite mods.
 - Tetra ruins now spawn in terralith biomes(see /trouble/data/tags/worldgen/biome/has_structure/forged_ruins.json)
 - Tetra ruins now have slightly increased spawn rate
 - Tetra geodes now spawn in chunks with terralith biomes
 - Tetra geodes now spawn in twilight forest?(no clue if this works but it's here lol)

tweaks(not really compat I just wanted them)
the dwarf origin's nightvision is now toggleable with the secondary ability key
  (for the forge port of medievalorigins{collection of singiro})
  
  
_NOTE_ some of these files don't change/overrwrite anything and are just there for reference
these files include -
src/trouble/data/tetra/tags/blocks/deepslate_ore_replaceables.json - lists the types of blocks that geodes can inhabit
src/trouble/data/tetra/tags/worldgen/forge/biome_modifier/geode_oregen.json - just for reference
src/trouble/data/tetra/tags/worldgen/worldgen/placed_feature/geode_ore.json
